Ever wonder the amounts of micro and macronutrients in your daily meals? I did, so in this project I mapped each staple food in my diet to a database containing the number of micro and macronutrients of each type of food I eat. 

I drew my main data set from the foodCentral database, which is organized by the US Department of Agriculture. This database contains many food items and their nutritional composition.
